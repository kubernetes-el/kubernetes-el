  etc.);

- Fetch and follow logs;
- Exec into containers;

- Much more.

## Installation

### MELPA

This package is available on the [MELPA][] package repository. See the
instructions there for how to configure Emacs to pull packages from MELPA.

Once you've set that up, use your preferred method of configuring and installing
packages. If you use [use-package][], the forms below will get you started.

```elisp
(use-package kubernetes
  :ensure t
  :commands (kubernetes-overview))

;; If you want to pull in the Evil compatibility package.
(use-package kubernetes-evil
  :ensure t
  :after kubernetes)
```

Otherwise, you can install the packages with `M-x package-install`.

### Installing manually

!!! note

    Installing manually requires Emacs 25 and [Cask][].

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el.git
cd kubernetes-el
make && make install
```
