# Getting Started

## About This Package

`kubernetes-el` is a Kubernetes client for Emacs. With `kubernetes-el` you can
manage your Kubernetes clusters much as you would with `kubectl`, but with
greater interactivity, less typing/copy-paste, and generally better ease-of-use.

`kubernetes-el` is still in early development stages, but we hope to enable
~80-90% of functionality you'd typically use `kubectl` for---with 10% of the
typing. :smile:

!!! warning

    This documentation assumes at least a working understanding of Kubernetes --
    what it is, its concepts, and how to work with it. If you're just beginning
    your Kubernetes journey, this documentation will do little to help you in
    that regard; we recommend looking elsewhere for general Kubernetes resources first.

!!! tip

    `kubernetes-el` is secretly a wrapper around `kubectl`. Don't tell anyone.

!!! info "Regarding feature parity with `kubectl`"

    `kubernetes-el` serves a similar purpose to `kubectl`. **However**, it does
    not aim to be a full replacement for `kubectl`. Rather, `kubernetes-el`
    aims to provide Emacs-based access to most common use cases.

## Installation

### MELPA

This package is available on the [MELPA][] package repository. See the
instructions there for how to configure Emacs to pull packages from MELPA.

Once you've set that up, use your preferred method of configuring and installing
packages.

=== "use-package"

    ```emacs-lisp
    (use-package kubernetes)
    ```

=== "straight.el"

    ```emacs-lisp
    (straight-use-package 'kubernetes)
    ```

    Or, if you use `straight.el` with `use-package`:

    ```emacs-lisp
    (use-package kubernetes
      :straight t)
    ```

If you'd like to pull in the Evil compatibility package, install the `kubernetes-evil` package as well.

=== "use-package"

    ```elisp
    (use-package kubernetes-evil
      :ensure t
      :after kubernetes)
    ```

=== "straight.el"

    ```emacs-lisp
    (straight-use-package 'kubernetes)
    (straight-use-package 'kubernetes-evil)
    ```

    Or, if you use `straight.el` with `use-package`:

    ```emacs-lisp
    (use-package kubernetes-evil
      :straight t
      :after kubernetes)
    ```

Otherwise, you can install the packages with `M-x package-install`.

### Manual

!!! note

    Installing manually requires Emacs 25 and [Cask][].

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el.git
cd kubernetes-el
make && make install
```

## Start the package

!!! warning

    Before starting the package, make sure you have [`kubectl`][kubectl] installed.

To start the package, use the entry-point command `kubernetes-overview`.

```
M-x kubernetes-overview
```

!!! tip

    You could consider defining a more concise alias for this command. For
    example, the following would allow you to enter the package via `M-x k8s`.

    ```emacs-lisp
    (fset 'k8s 'kubernetes-overview)
    ```

You'll enter the Overview pane. This is where you'll likely spend the majority
of your time with `kubernetes-el` and where the majority of your interactions
will take place.

## Next Steps

You're done! Feel free to start poking around on your own; `describe-mode` will
give you a good overview. Otherwise, for more structured guidance, check out the
