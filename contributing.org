#+TITLE: Contributing
#+DESCRIPTION: Documentation on internals for contributors.

Hello there, intrepid contributor! Please see the [[file:Readme.md][Readme]] for basic information
about this project.

If you would like to submit a bug report or contribute code or documentation,
read over the guidelines below for the expectations. Then follow the development
setup steps to get started.

* Contribution Guidelines

The first thing you should do is browse the GitHub issues for discussion
relating to the bug or feature you're interested in. Do your best here!

** Bug reports

Make sure you're using the latest release of the package, and are using
Emacs 25.

If no ticket exists yet, you can write a new issue. Provide reproduction steps
if you can, as well as your Emacs version and basic OS info.

If the issue relates to integration with =kubectl=, make sure to supply your
=kubectl= version.

** Code changes

For code changes, please follow the following guidelines.

- Create a GitHub issue to track your work
- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Create a feature branch for your PR
- Take the time to write good commit messages
- Run tests and make sure they all pass before submitting your PR.

* Development setup

You will need some third-party tools to build this project. Emacs 25+, GNU Make
and [[https://github.com/cask/cask][Cask]] are the most important.

You do not need =kubectl= installed in order to run tests, but you do need it to
run the package inside Emacs.

If you want to contribute code changes, you should fork the repository.
Otherwise clone the main repo.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# If forked
git clone "git@github.com:<username>/kubernetes-el.git"

# Otherwise
git clone "git@github.com:chrisbarrett/kubernetes-el.git"
#+END_SRC

Running make will tell you if you need to install anything to hack on the
project:

#+BEGIN_SRC
cd kubernetes-el
make
#+END_SRC

As a final check, run tests to make sure everything works. All tests should
pass.

#+BEGIN_SRC
make test
#+END_SRC

* Implementation Notes

Below are some general notes to help make sense of this beast. The main points
to understand are:

- This package implements a state manager
- A timer is used to fetch information from Kubernetes and update the state
- Another timer is used to compile the state into a representation of the
  overview buffer, which is then interpreted.

The separation of state from rendering improves testability, and makes it easier
to develop view components that can be reused throughout the package.

** State Management

This package implements its own state manager, which provides structured
mechanisms for accessing the application state. The state can be read using the
[[file:kubernetes-state.el::(defun%20kubernetes-state%20()][kubernetes-state]] routine, and the package implements a suite of accessor
functions for reading and modifying specific parts of the state.

The core of the state manager is the function [[file:kubernetes-state.el::(defun%20kubernetes-state-next%20(state%20action%20&optional%20args)][kubernetes-state-next]], which is a
pure function taking the current state, an action to perform, and any arguments
required for that action. Its return value is the next application state.

In order to actually make changes to the state, the [[file:kubernetes-state.el::(defun%20kubernetes-state-update%20(action%20&optional%20args)][kubernetes-state-update]]
routine is used to evaluate an action and arguments and store the updated state.
Other update routines are built around it, providing a more structured interface
to the state manager.

** State Updates

A timer is used to trigger polling processes which query Kubernetes for its
state and resources. This timer starts when the overview buffer is opened, and
repeats until that buffer is killed.

The polling timer runs a hook, =kubernetes-poll-hook=, which in turn runs the
polling routines that update the application state.

The routine [[file:kubernetes-state.el::(defun%20kubernetes-state-trigger-redraw%20()][kubernetes-state-trigger-redraw]] is the main routine used to trigger
a redraw. It runs a hook, =kubernetes-redraw-hook=, which is used to signal that a
redraw should occur. This routine is sometimes triggered manually, but is most
often triggered by the redraw timer. See [[file:kubernetes-timers.el::(defvar%20kubernetes-timers--redraw-timer%20nil][kubernetes-timers]].

Aside from the polling processes, certain interactive commands, popup buffers
and other UI elements can update parts of the state.

Rendering is mostly decoupled from state management, so redrawing occurs
asynchronously from state updates caused by polling. However, as a special case
a redraw is triggered the first time each state variable is set. This ensures
the UI displays values as soon as possible when the porcelain is started.

** Rendering

This package implements a DSL (domain-specific language) used to specify how
objects should be rendered in the UI.

Rendering the overview buffer is divided into two stages:

1. Take the current state and compile an AST of the desired changes
2. Erase the buffer and interpret the AST to execute the changes ([[file:kubernetes.el::;;%20Render%20AST%20Interpreter][here]]).

Future optimizations could include dirty checking to only update certain parts
of the buffer.

[[file:kubernetes-ast.el][kubernetes-ast.el]] contains the implementation of the interpreter for the AST. It
implements the core forms and provides a macro, [[file:kubernetes-ast.el::(defmacro%20kubernetes-ast-define-component%20(name%20arglist%20&rest%20body)][kubernetes-ast-define-component]],
that allows the interpreter to be extended with custom components implemented in
terms of the AST.

** Feature dependencies

The chart below shows the dependencies between features, excluding
=kubernetes-state=, =kubernets-props= and =kubernetes-modes= which are direct
dependencies of many modules.
