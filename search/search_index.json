The state can be read using the [kubernetes-state](kubernetes-state.el::(defun%20kubernetes-state%20()) routine, and the package implements a suite of accessor functions for reading and modifying specific parts of the state.</p> <p>The core of the state manager is the function <code>kubernetes-state-next</code>, which is a pure function taking the current state, an action to perform, and any arguments required for that action. Its return value is the next application state.</p> <p>In order to actually make changes to the state, the <code>kubernetes-state-update</code> routine is used to evaluate an action and arguments and store the updated state. Other update routines are built around it, providing a more structured interface to the state manager.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/#state-updates","title":"State Updates","text":"<p>A timer is used to trigger polling processes which query Kubernetes for its state and resources. This timer starts when the overview buffer is opened, and repeats until that buffer is killed.</p> <p>The polling timer runs a hook, <code>kubernetes-poll-hook</code>, which in turn runs the polling routines that update the application state.</p> <p>The routine <code>kubernetes-state-trigger-redraw</code> is the main routine used to trigger a redraw. It runs a hook, <code>kubernetes-redraw-hook</code>, which is used to signal that a redraw should occur. This routine is sometimes triggered manually, but is most often triggered by the redraw timer. See <code>kubernetes-timers.el</code>.</p> <p>Aside from the polling processes, certain interactive commands, popup buffers and other UI elements can update parts of the state.</p> <p>Rendering is mostly decoupled from state management, so redrawing occurs asynchronously from state updates caused by polling.
