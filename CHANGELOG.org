* Upcoming

** Changed
   
   - New overview for persistent volume claims. ([[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/pull/223][#223]])
   - Added a new interactive function, =kubernetes-contexts-rename=, for
     renaming contexts. ([[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/pull/231][#231]])
   - Added a new transient prefix, =kubernetes-context=, for acting on kubectl
     contexts, e.g. switching, renaming, etc. ([[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/pull/231][#231]])
   - Quitting via `Q` from the overview or any =kubernetes-mode= buffer now
     terminates all in-flight background processes. ([[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/pull/244][#244]])

** Refinements

   - We've taken a big step towards [[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/issues/69][support for custom resources]], overhauling
     the process-tracking module -- how =kubernetes-el= keeps track of the
     various =kubectl= processes that it spins up -- to be resource agnostic
     ([[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/issues/234][#234]]). This removes another section of the codebase that historically has
     had to be updated for every new resource that =kubernetes-el= wants to
     "support," allowing it to accommodate any and all resources. See: [[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/pull/237][#237]];
     [[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/pull/238][#238]].
     
* 0.17.0
  
** Changed

   - Explicitly disable the =Exec into container using vterm= suffix of the
     =kubernetes-exec= transient if =vterm= is not installed ([[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/pull/209][#209]])
     
** Fixed

   - Some of the migrated transients from 0.16.0 were incomplete; we catch some
     (hopefully all of) the stragglers in this release. Thanks @noorul for the
     follow-through here.
     
   - Fixed a bug in Ingress display. ([[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/pull/214][#214]])
   
* 0.16.0
  
** Changed

   - Ability to find files in pods via =tramp= ([[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/pull/167][#167]])
   - Ability to exec into pods via [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][vterm]] ([[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/pull/169][#169]])
   - Ability to edit resources ([[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/pull/186][#186]])
   - Migrate several popups from the defunct `magit-popup` to `transient` ([[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/pull/190][#190]],
     [[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/pull/193][#193]], [[https://github.com/kubernetes-el/kubernetes-el/pull/198][#198]], etc.)
